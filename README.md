# Live-Graphics

Well, I love little animations, even when I look at up just a simple fade animation, I get excited about how the dev made it. I was challenged by my friend to make live animations in python and the task had to be achieved without the use of any image and without any other library than Tkinter…. However, I did found a way or you can say a function - .after() in Tkinter where with the use of a recursive function, I can do little animations, such as moving some elements around or do some backend calculations or changes again and again. Being a man of culture, I decided to simply make the ‘THE MATRIX’ animation where gibberish text is falling, but with a little twist. Here one line will fall down and one line will go up, so it kinda looks good but doesn’t give the feel of the matrix. Considering I had to make it under 30 minutes, I think it’s pretty good. It has a bug in it due to which after a few seconds the text starts to disappear…. If you can solve it then create a pull request and I’ll be happy with you being on board!
